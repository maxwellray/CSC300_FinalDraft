	\section{Abstract of Analysis}
	\subsection{EPA Software Engineer's Role}
	This section will take a look at what is expected of an EPA software engineer in terms of credentials and experience. It will also take a look at the powers granted to EPA software engineers, as well as the resources afforded them. It will show that the typical EPA software engineer possesses neither the education nor the political sway nor the funds to adequately prepare for car companies attempting to exploit their tests.\cite{epa_track,software_engineering_analysis,software_transparency}
	\subsection{Scope of Volkswagen's Exploitation}
	This section will analyze the steps taken by Volkswagen to cheat the EPA's emissions test and show that for the EPA's software engineers to have caught the device, they would have had to go to above and beyond what should be expected of them, and that they were therefore not at fault for not catching Volkswagen. \cite{cheating_analysis,vw_ethics}
