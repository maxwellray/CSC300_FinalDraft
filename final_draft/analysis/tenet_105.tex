\subsubsection{Tenet}
\boxed{
    \ul{Cooperate} in \ul{efforts} to \ul{address} matters of \ul{grave} \ul{public} \ul{concern} caused by \ul{software}, its \ul{installation}, maintenance, support or documentation.
}

\level{4}{Definitions}

\level{5}{Cooperate}
To cooperate is defined as ``to work together or act jointly for a common purpose or benefit''\cite{dictionary_com}.


\level{6}{Common}
Common is defined as ``belonging equally to, or shared alike by, two or more or all in question''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{6}{Benefit}
Benefit is defined as ``something that is advantageous or good; an advantage''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{6}{Reconstruction}
Using the above definitions, to cooperate means ``to work together for something advantageous that is shared equally by all''.

\level{5}{Efforts}
Efforts are defined as ``earnest or strenuous attempts''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{6}{Earnest}
Earnest is defined as ``serious in intention, purpose, or effort; sincerely zealous''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{7}{Serious}
Serious is defined as ``requiring thought, concentration, or application''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{6}{Reconstruction}
Using the above definitions, Effors are defined as ``attempts requiring thought''.

\level{5}{Address}

\level{5}{Grave}
Grave is defined as ``threatening a seriously bad outcome or involving serious issues''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{6}{Serious}
See 5.3.1.1.2.1.1.

\level{6}{Reconstruction}
Using the above definitions, grave means ``threatening an outcome which requires thought, concentration, or application''.

\level{5}{Public}
Public is defined as ``of, relating to, or affecting a population as a whole''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{Concern}
Concern is defined as ``a matter that engages a person's attention, interest, or care, or that affects a person's welfare or happiness''\cite{dictionary_com}

\level{6}{Welfare}

\level{6}{Reconstruction}
Using the above definitions, concern is defined as ``a matter that affects a person's good health''.

\level{5}{Software}
The definition for software will be the same as the one provided above\footnote{5.1.1.8.1}, and is defined as ``the software on VW's cars''.

\level{5}{Installation}
Installation is defined as ``the act of placing in position or connect for service or use''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{4}{Domain Specific Tenet 1.05}
\boxed{
    The EPA's engineers should \ul{work together} in \ul{attempts requiring thought} to \ul{direct to the attention} matters \ul{that threaten a population's good health or environment in such a way as to require thought, concentration, or application} caused by \ul{the software on VW's cars} or its \ul{connection for service or use}.
}

\level{4}{Analysis}
\level{5}{Attempts Requiring Thought}
The EPA's engineers are accredited\cite{anab_accreditation} by ANAB\cite{anab_recognition} to design and implement proper lab tests. Therefore, the thought required to produce tests which merit accreditation can be considered serious.

\level{5}{Direct to the Attention}
The EPA releases yearly reports on the emissions data they collect, grouped by car manufacturer\cite{epa_ghg_report}. This report directs the attention of the public to the emissions of various car companies, and provides consumers with access to information that aids in educated consumption of goods from the automotive industry.

\level{5}{Matters that Threaten a Population's Good Health Caused by the Software on VW's Cars}
The report\cite{epa_ghg_report} released by the EPA specifically separates VW from the rest of the data, stating that it is because the company is under investigation, and that readers should be wary of the data provided for VW. The report additionally states that before using the data given for VW, readers should attempt to find more up-to-date information, as results yielding from ongoing investigations will only be reflected in future reports.

\level{4}{Conclusion}
The EPA's engineers have been proven to have worked together in serious attempts, as shown by their ANAB accreditation\cite{anab_accreditation}. They have taken efforts to direct the attention of the public through their annual reports on vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions\cite{epa_ghg_report}. They have created distinctions between data compliant with the EPA's emissions guidelines and VW's data, which may not be reliable. Through their actions, the EPA's engineers have taken direct steps to ensure compliance with Tenet 1.05 of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics.
