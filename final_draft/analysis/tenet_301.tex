\subsection{Tenet 3.01}
\subsubsection{Tenet}
\boxed{
    \ul{Strive} for \ul{high} quality, \ul{acceptable} cost and a \ul{reasonable} schedule, ensuring significant \ul{trade-offs are clear to and accepted by} the employer and the client, and are \ul{available for consideration} by the user and the public.
}

\level{4}{Definitions}
\level{5}{Strive}
To strive is defined as ``to exert oneself vigorously; try hard''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{High, Acceptable, Reasonable}
High is defined as ``exceeding the common degree or measure; strong; intense''. Acceptable is defined as ``pleasing to the receiver; satisfactory; agreeable; welcome''\cite{dictionary_com}. Reasonable is defined as ``agreeable to reason or sound judgment; logical''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{Trade-offs}
A trade-off is defined as ``the exchange of one thing for another of more or less equal value, especially to effect a compromise''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{Clear}
Clear is defined as ``free from ... obscurity,...''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{Accepted}
Accepted is defined as ``generally approved, usually regarded as ... right,...''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{5}{Available for Consideration}
Available is defined as ``readily obtainable; accessible''\cite{dictionary_com}. Consideration is defined as ``...; careful thought; ... deliberation''\cite{dictionary_com}.

Available for consideration can therefore be defined as ``readily obtainable for deliberation''.

\level{4}{Domain Specific Tenet 3.01}
\boxed{
    EPA engineers should \ul{exert themselves vigorously} to attain quality \ul{exceeding the common degree or measure}, \ul{agreeable} cost, and a \ul{logical} schedule, ensuring significant \ul{exchanges of one thing for another of more or less equal value are not obscured from and are generally approved by} the employer and the client, and are \ul{readily obtainable for deliberation} by the user and the public.

\level{4}{Analysis}
\level{5}{Level of Exertion}
The EPA demonstrates high quality test results through their ANAB accreditation\cite{anab_accreditation}, which states that they are able to adequately design and implement lab tests. Furthermore, the EPA's mission is to ``protect human health and the environment'', and that they accomplish this by producing regulations to enforce environmental laws produced by Congress\cite{epa_mission}. As the standard body for enforcement of environmental regulation, the EPA is a representation of the wants of its clients, and therefore produces results of high quality that are acceptably priced and reasonably scheduled.

\level{5}{Exchanges of One Thing for Another}
The EPA's engineers' emissions tests must produce results\cite{epa_ghg_report} which state whether a vehicle is in compliance with emissions regulations. The acceptable levels of emissions are released by the EPA\cite{emissions_standards}, and act as lines that optimize both environmental impact and vehicular utility.

\level{5}{Obscurity of Exchanges/Readily Obtainable for Deliberation}
In order to ensure that all trade-offs between the EPA and its clients (the American people) regarding emissions testing are made clear, the EPA makes public all information pertaining to the acceptable standards for emissions\cite{emissions_standards}.

\level{4}{Conclusion}
Because the EPA's engineers released their test track information to the public\cite{emissions_standards}, VW was able to know beforehand how their cars would be tested\cite{emissions_cars_affected}, and design their defeat devices accordingly. Had the EPA's engineers not released the test track information, VW would have been unable to prepare a device that was able to cheat the emissions test in the way that it did.

However, had the EPA's engineers \textit{not} released the test track information\cite{emissions_standards}, they would have increased the obscurity of any trade-offs they were required to make in their test design process, and their clients would not have been able to retrieve these trade-offs for deliberation.

Although VW was able to take advantage of the EPA's transparency\cite{emissions_cars_affected}, it is not the fault of the EPA's engineers, who were taking actions that placed them in accordance with this tenet of the SE Code\cite{emissions_standards}. The EPA's engineers were required to remain open with their clients, the American people, in order to remain in accordance with this tenet of the SE code.
