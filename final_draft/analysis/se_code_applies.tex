\subsection{How the SE Code Applies}
\subsubsection{Software Engineer}
The Software Engineering Code\cite{se_code} defines a software engineer as ``[an engineer] who contributes by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis,..., certification, ... and testing of software systems''. 

\level{4}{Contribute}
Contribute is defined as ``to give to a common supply''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{4}{Direct Participation}
Direct is defined as ``proceeding in an unbroken line of descent''\cite{dictionary_com}. To proceed is defined as ``to carry on or continue any action or process''\cite{dictionary_com}. Descent is defined as ``derivation from an ancestor; lineage; extraction''\cite{dictionary_com}. Ancestor is defined as ``an object, idea, style, or occurrence serving as a prototype, forerunner, or inspiration to a later one''\cite{dictionary_com}. . Participation is defined as ``the fact\footnote{Not a typo} of taking part, as in some action or attempt''\cite{dictionary_com}. 

Direct participation can therefore be defined as ``the fact of taking part, as in some action or attempt that is carried on in an unbroken line of derivatives of forerunners''.

\level{4}{Analysis}
Analysis is defined as ``the separating of any material or abstract entity into its constituent elements''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{4}{Certification}
Certification is defined as ``the act of guaranteeing or endorsing reliably''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{4}{Testing}
Testing is defined as ``the means by which the presence, quality, or genuineness of anything is determined; a means of trial''\cite{dictionary_com}.

\level{4}{Software System}
Software is defined as ``the programs used to direct the operation of a computer,...''\cite{dictionary_com}. A system is defined as ``an assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a complex unitary whole''. A software system can therefore be defined as ``any assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a program used to direct the operation of a computer''.

\level{4}{Software Engineer Definition}
Using the definitions above, a software engineer can be defined as ``an engineer who gives to a common supply by taking part, as in some action or attempt that is carried on in an unbroken line of derivatives or forerunners, or by teaching, to (1) the separating of any material or abstract entity into its constituent elements, (2) the act of guaranteeing or endorsing reliably, and (3) the determination of the presence, quality, or genuineness of any assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a program used to direct the operation of a computer''.

\level{4}{Analysis}
\level{5}{Software System}
The EPA's engineers were tasked with measuring and certifying the emissions of VW's cars\cite{epa_track}. Therefore, their duties align with those stated in the definition of software engineer above, while the software on VW's cars were the systems being analyzed.

\level{5}{Summary}
From our definition, we can see that the role of the EPA's engineers as software engineers was to break down the software running VW's cars and reliably endorse their quality and genuineness.
