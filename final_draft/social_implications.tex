\section{Social Implications}
Volkswagen's ability to cheat the EPA's emissions tests begs the question: Is the government an effective defender of human health? There are several examples of times when the government has failed to adequately regulate industry to the detriment of its citizens' health\cite{9_11_report,2008_housing_crisis}. In these cases, it is important to determine whether the shortcomings of government regulation originate in perceived needs, policy, implementation, or assurance\cite{what_is_security}. To better understand what can be done to improve government's ability to protect the consumer, it is important to look at government's role in the failure. While it is not possible to fully protect a system from exploitation, there must be a determination made as to whether government expends an adequate amount of effort when designing and implementing tests. This determination is more important now then ever, as the auto industry faces a revolution that brings with it several moral questions\cite{software_engineering_analysis}.
