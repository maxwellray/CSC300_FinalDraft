\section{Facts}
A study\cite{study} conducted by West Virginia University shows that several models of Volkswagen diesel cars\cite{emissions_cars_affected} produced Nitrogen Oxide emissions at levels of almost 40 times the legal limit\cite{study}. The results of this study were at odds with those of the EPA's emissions tests\cite{study} on the same vehicles, which showed their emissions as being at acceptable levels. After these results had come to light, Volkswagen admitted\cite{course_detection} to installing a software mechanism in their diesel cars which would detect when the cars were being tested by the EPA. The cars would then optimize certain components of the engine cycle to reduce emissions, thus reporting results which were inconsistent with those that one would see under everyday driving conditions. Volkswagen was able to detect the track used by the EPA, as it is freely available to view\cite{epa_track}. Because Volkswagen knew the specifics of the test, they were able to use time-distance curves\cite{cheating_analysis} coupled with a measure of atmospheric pressure to set a flag which would temporarily decrease the emissions of their vehicles until the testing conditions were no longer met.
