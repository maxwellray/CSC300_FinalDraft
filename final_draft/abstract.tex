\section*{Abstract}
In 2014, a study\cite{study} conducted by West Virginia University determined that several models of Volkswagen diesel car\cite{emissions_cars_affected} produced emissions of Nitrogen Oxide at almost 40 times the legal limit\cite{study}. It was discovered that Volkswagen took steps to mask the emissions of their cars during EPA testing\cite{cheating_analysis}. Were EPA engineers in violation of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics? While the EPA should have designed better tests\cite{epa_track}, it is impossible to guarantee that any test is immune to exploitation. This question deals with SE Code\cite{se_code} tenets 1.03, 1.05, and 3.01. EPA staff were \textit{not} in violation of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics because their actions were consistently in compliance with the Code.
